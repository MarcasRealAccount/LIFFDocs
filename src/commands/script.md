# Script

The **`Script`** command expresses a script for a component.  
This command is incompatible with **`TruthTable`**, **`Graph`** and **`GraphRender`**.  
(*This command is optionally supported by the program, if a component uses this command the program should then scream at the user under this message "NO_SCRIPTING"*)

The syntax for the command is as follows
```
Script [ScriptPath]
```

### **ScriptPath**

A unix filepath to a script file.  
**The functionality will be described in the future.**
