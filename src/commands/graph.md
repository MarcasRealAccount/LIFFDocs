# Graph

The **`Graph`** command group expresses a graph for a component.  
A graph is like a collection of nodes comprised of components, and a collection of connections between nodes.  
This makes for a rather optimized and interchangeable format for simulating a component.

The sub commands you can use within a **`Graph`** is:
- [Version](./graph/version.md)
- [Depend](./graph/depend.md)
- [Node](./graph/node.md)
- [Connections](./graph/connections.md)
